== Step 1: Installation

1. Copy driver file into your Arduino sketchbook

2. Copy controller file into Processing

== Step 2: Load the code

1. Upload the driver on to your board

2. Make sure the serial monitor is disconnected

== Step 3: Run the controller

1. Start the controller program

2. Follow prompts to select the port that your board is connected to

3. Select the small black window that appears

4. The arrow keys control pitch and yaw; W and S control forwards and backwards
